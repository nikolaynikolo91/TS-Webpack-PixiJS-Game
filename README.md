## Installation

requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

#### Building for source

## Start the server

Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the server will expose port 9000.

```sh
http://localhost:9000
```
